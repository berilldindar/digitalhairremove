# digitalhairremove

Many datasets are being created for melanoma cancer. Education is carried out with these visuals and cancer detection projects are created with artificial neural networks. However, in such images, there are hairs that we define as noise. We can remove such noises by being careful not to distort the image and use them in our cancer detection projects. This project has been developed in order to increase the accuracy of our model.

 You can experience the created repo and report your problems. thanks.

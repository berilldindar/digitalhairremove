Many datasets are being created for melanoma cancer. Education is carried out with these visuals and cancer detection projects are created with artificial neural networks. However, in such images, there are hairs that we define as noise. This type of noise can be used by being careful not to distort the image and can be used in our cancer detection projects, this project has been developed in order to increase our accuracy values.

 You can experience the created repo and report your problems. thanks.
